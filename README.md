**Requirement**
- Python3
- Os module
- Subprocess module
- Nmap
- Metasploit Framework

**Purpose**

- Metasploit framework is an essential tool for discovering hidden vulnerabilities using a variety of tools and utilities. Metasploit allows you to enter the mind of a hacker and use the same methods for probing and infiltrating networks and servers. 
- F-cybot was developed to ease the job of the security professional testing for thousands of vulnerabilities by automating the entire metasploit tool. This tool was written in python to allow flexibility. F-cybot interfaces with remote control files (.rc) to automate metasploit. This tool gives the security professional a lot more time to focus on other aspects of the engagement as exploitation of vulnerabilities by metasploit can be automated using this tool.


**N/B: This tool should only be use for educational purposes or an authorized penetration test engagement**
